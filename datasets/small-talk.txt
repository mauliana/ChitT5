My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street. Why don’t you go there?
I know I should, but that place isn’t very convenient. You have to wait for a long time.
Yes I know. I have to do it every week. Anyway, are you ready to go?

OK, but please hurry. I think the restaurant is closing soon.

Well, you could go down to 22nd street. There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day.

No, from here I think it’s only about 5 dollars.

No, I’m going to go back to the hotel at lunchtime to lie down.
I’m going to the drug store later. Is there anything I can get for you?
No, that’s OK. I think if I rest for a little while, I’ll feel better.

I’d like to go see a movie.
I heard Titanic is playing at the movie theater.

Yes, that’ll be fine. I’ll meet you at your house at 5:00 PM.
Do you want to get something to eat before the movie?
I’m not sure there will be enough time for that. We can have popcorn and hot dogs at the theater if you want.
I don’t like the popcorn they have there. I think they put too much salt on it.
OK then, I’ll pick you up a little earlier and we can go to the Thai restaurant next to the theater, is that OK?
Yes, I like that place.
###
How do you like the food?
It tastes really great. Did you cook it?
Yes. I made it this afternoon. Would you like some more?
OK, just a little though. I’m really full.
Oh. Would you like some soup instead?
What kind is it?
Tomato and rice. Have you had that before?
No. This is my first time. How does it taste?
It’s good, try it. What do you think?
Wow. It is good. Did you make that also?
Yes.
You’re a really good cook.
Thanks, next time I’ll make chicken soup for us.
That sounds good. Did you study cooking in school?
No, I learned by myself. I have a good cookbook that I read when I have time. 
###
Kelly, will you help me take these things to the car?
OK, which car do you want me to put them in?
Bring them to my wife’s car.
Which one is hers?
The blue SUV in front of the Honda.
What should I take first?
That chair over there, but please be careful with it. It was a gift from my mother-in-law.
Don’t worry, I won’t drop it. Wow, it’s really heavy. I don’t think I can move it by myself.
Let me help you with that. I don’t want you to hurt your back.
Where are you taking all this stuff?
Didn’t I tell you? We’re moving to Florida?
You’re moving now? I knew you were moving, but I thought you said you were moving next month.
Yes, that’s true, but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away.
###
Judy, your husband has a really nice car.
Thanks. It’s a lot better than mine, and it’s new.
Where are you going?
We’re going to visit my sister in the city.
I didn’t know your sister lives in the city, when did she move there?
About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, across from the public library.
I see. It’s almost 5:00 PM now, don’t you think there will be a lot of traffic?
Oh, we’re not driving. We’re going to take the subway. The subway only takes about 20 minutes.
Yes, but it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.
I take the subway to work every day, so I’m used to it now.
Doesn’t your mother live in the city?
Yes, she’s lived there for about ten years.
I remember when she moved there. Apartments were a lot cheaper then.
I know what you mean. It’s hard to find anything that’s reasonable now.
Have a good time. Next time you’re free, give me a call and we’ll go play poker.
See you later.
###
Jim, I heard you took a trip to San Diego. Is that right?
Yeah, I just got back this morning.
That sounds really nice. What did you do there?
Well, we were only there for three days, so we didn’t do too much. We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times. At night we walked around the city with some friends.
Did you take any pictures?
Yes, I have them with me. Do you want to look at them?
Sure, I love looking at photos.
This one is of my wife and me on the beach, and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife.
Your daughter looks like her mother.
I know, they look very similar.
Where was this picture taken?
That was taken at the train station before we left.
Did you have time to go to the zoo?
No, not this time. We went there last time.
It looks like you all had a nice time.
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
###
Good afternoon, how may I help you?
Hi, I’d like to order some flowers.
Who are they for?
They’re for my Wife. Her name is Samantha.
What kind of flowers would you like?
I don’t know. I don’t know too much about flowers. Can you recommend something?
What’s the reason you are sending her flowers?
Today’s her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers.
Do you know what kind of flowers she likes?
I’m not sure. I know I should know that, but I can’t remember right now.
Well, they’re for your wife, so I think you should give her roses.
Roses will be fine.
What color?
I think red would be nice.
Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them?
Can you deliver them please?
What’s the address?
241 Main street.
Alright, they’ll be there within 2 hours. 
###
Hello?
Hi, is Heather there, please?
Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.
Is this 617-228-2289?
Yes. Who are you looking for again?
Heather Johnson.
Oh, I thought you said Laura. Sorry about that. This is the right number, but Heather’s not here right now.
Do you know where she went?
She went to the store to buy some groceries. Would you like to leave a message?
Yes, would you please tell her Eric Martin called?
Hi Eric, this is her roommate Kathy. I met you a couple of months ago at the Christmas party.
Oh, yes. How are you?
Good. Heather will be back in about 20 minutes. I’ll tell her you called.
Thanks.
Bye bye.
###
Hello
Hi Tina, It’s Joe.
Hi Joe.
How’s the weather there today?
It’s really cold. It snowed all day and the schools closed early.
What’s the temperature?
It’s 30 degrees now. It was even colder this morning.
Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?
I was watching the news a little earlier. They said it’s probably going to snow tomorrow.
I really don’t like the winter. I wish it were summer.
Me too. How’s the weather where you are?
It’s not too bad, but it’s pretty cold here too. It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon. I heard it’s going to be a little warmer tomorrow.
###
It’s almost Christmas. What are you doing this weekend?
Nothing special, just working. Why do you ask?
Well, I still haven’t finished my Christmas shopping. Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend?
I’d like to, but I’m not sure if I can. Work has been really busy lately. Why don’t we go on Friday instead?
Friday’s not good. I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work.
OK, then let’s try to go this weekend. I should know if I can go by Friday. Is it OK if I call you then?
Yeah, that’s fine.
What’s your number?
233-331-8828. Let me give you my email address too. It’s sara@gmail.com
OK, I’ll talk to you soon.
OK.
###
Hello
Hi Vicky.
Are you there yet?
Yes.
I just got off the subway. I’m almost there. Sorry, I’m late.
That’s no problem. I just wanted to tell you I’m inside.
Where are you?
On the second floor.
Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor?
Come upstairs.
What?
Oh, Can you hear me OK? I said, come to the second floor.
Oh, OK. What are you doing there?
Just looking at some books on how to learn English.
Do you want to get something to eat later?
No, I’m still full from dinner.
What do you want to do?
I don’t know for sure. When you get here we’ll talk about it.
OK, see you soon.
Bye.
###
Craig, what do you do for work?
I’m still a student.
What school do you go to?
Boston University.
That’s a good school. What do you study?
I’m studying English, math, and history. My major is English.
How long have you been studying English?
More than six years.
That’s a long time.
Yeah, I started to learn English when I was in high school.
No wonder your English is so good.
Actually, it’s not that good. I can read but I can’t speak very well. I haven’t had a lot of chances to practice.
I see. Talking with other people is very important.
Yes, but I still don’t have many friends here yet.
I’m having a party tonight at my apartment. You should come.
Oh thanks for inviting me. I’d love to come. 
###
Hi Kim.
Hey Shawn, good to see you again.
How have you been?
OK, I didn’t sleep much last night though. I stayed up until 2 AM studying for an exam.
I was up late last night too. The semester is almost over. I’ve had exams all week.
Are you going back to California after you graduate?
I think so. After I graduate I’ll probably go back home and try to get a job.
Do you know where you’d like to work?
Not yet, but I want to be an English translator.
That’d be really cool. I’d like to be a translator too, but I don’t think my English is good enough.
Don’t worry about that. Your English is better than most of my classmates.
Thanks. Where are you going now?
I’m going to study at the library. I have to take an exam tomorrow.
Me too. How late does the library stay open?
I think it’s open until 11:30 PM.
OK, Good luck.
You too.
###
Hello?
Hi Angela, it’s Dan.
Hi Dan. How are you?
Good.
I called you yesterday. Did you get my message?
Yes, I was taking a shower when you called. I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, but I think your phone was off.
No problem. I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week. You’re still coming to the wedding with me, right?
Oh, is that next week?
Yes. Did you forget?
No, of course not. I already bought them a present.
That’s good. I want to invite Megan also. Next time you see her, can you tell her for me.
Sure. Does she know your friend?
Yes, I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that. I’m not exactly sure how they know each other.
Are we all going to drive together?
Yes. I’ll pick you up first, and then we’ll go get Megan. 
###
Hi, I’d like to see the doctor, please.
Do you have an appointment?
No.
When would you like an appointment?
Is today possible?
Yes. Today is fine. What time would you like?
As soon as possible. My stomach really hurts.
Please wait a moment. I’ll see if the doctor is available.
OK.
Sorry, he’s with a patient right now. It’s probably going to be about another 30 minutes. Would you mind waiting a little longer?
No problem.
May I see your insurance card, please?
Here you are.
Thanks. That’s going to be 25 dollars for today’s visit.
Really? I didn’t think it would be that much.
I know how you feel.
I’ll pay with cash.
Thank you.
Would you please turn on the heat? It’s really cold in here.
It is cold in here, isn’t it? I’ll take care of that in a moment. Please have a seat and fill out these forms. Bring them back to me when you’re done.
###
Hey Jane, did you get the mail yet?
Yes. I picked it up this morning. There were a few bills and a letter from my mother. There was also a lot of junk mail.
Was there anything for me?
I don’t remember, let me check. Yes, it looks like there’s something here for you.
Who’s it from?
The American Embassy.
My hands are dirty. Will you open it for me?
What does it say?
It says your passport is ready. You can pick it up anytime.
Do you think you can drive me there?
Sure, when?
I think we should go get it now. I’m going to wash my hands and then we’ll go. Is that OK?
###
How are you feeling?
I still have a cold.
Still? It’s been over a week now, hasn’t it?
Yeah, it’s been a while. I started feeling this way last Monday.
Are you feeling any better?
A little. I took some medicine this morning and I feel a little better now.
What’s wrong?
I have a bad cough.
Did you go see the doctor yet?
Not yet, I might go tomorrow.
I’m going to the drug store now, can I get you anything?
Yes, if it’s not too much trouble, would you get me some tissues.
Sure. Anything else?
No, that’s it.
OK, I’ll be back in about an hour. If you think of anything else you need, give me a call.
Thanks.
###
Hi James, it’s good to see you again.
Hi Barbara.
Are you here for work?
Yes.
Is Steve with you?
No, I’m here alone. Steve couldn’t come this time.
How long will you be staying?
4 days. I’m going back on Friday.
My brother and I are getting together for dinner. Do you want to come with us?
Yeah, that would be nice. I have a meeting in an hour. I can meet you afterward if that’s OK. The meeting shouldn’t last long.
That’s fine. Who is your meeting with?
The Boston Insurance Company. I’ll call you when it’s over.
OK.
Can I use your phone? I left mine in the car and I want to call them to get directions.
Sure, here you go.
###
Hello?
Hi Frank, it’s Pam.
Hey Pam, what’s up?
Not much. Where are you?
I’m in the car driving home.
When you get home, will you send me an email with directions to the party tonight?
Sure, no problem.
When do you think you’ll get home?
I don’t know, maybe in about 30 minutes or so. There’s a lot of traffic.
I have to go out soon. Can you just send me a text message with the address instead?
OK, I’ll do that as soon as I get home.
Thanks a lot. Drive carefully.
OK, I’ll see you tonight.
Bye. 
###
Hello
Hi Sharon, it’s George again. What time do you think you’ll get to the party tonight?
Sorry, what did you say?
Hello, can you hear me? I said what time do you think you’ll be getting to the party?
Sorry, I can’t hear you.
Can you hear me now?
No, not very clearly. It’s really noisy here.
It might be my cell phone, I don’t think I have very good reception.
Oh, that’s OK.
Can I call you right back?
###
Ed, what should we do today?
I have been studying all week. I’d like to exercise.
Me too. Let’s go to the gym.
Good idea. What are we going to do there?
We can lift weights or play basketball.
I like to play basketball. Are you good at it?
Not really, but I like to play. I use to play a lot when I was in school, but now there’s no time.
I know what you mean. I used to play soccer a lot. Do you think we can play soccer there?
No, there’s not enough room. I think it’s better if we play outside.
OK, maybe we can go play soccer later this afternoon.
It’s too cold outside today. Let’s wait until the weather gets a little warmer.
OK.
###
Anthony, are you OK?
I’m OK now, but I got into a car accident this morning.
Were you hurt?
No, but my neck is still a little sore.
What happened?
I wasn’t paying attention and I hit a car that stopped in front of me.
Were the people in the other car all right?
Yes, they’re fine. I wasn’t going very fast.
Were you wearing a seatbelt?
Yes.
Did the police come?
Yeah, I called them on my cell phone right after it happened.
Do you want me to drive you home?
No, I need to go get my car fixed this afternoon.
###

I don’t feel good.
What’s bothering you?
I have a stomachache and a headache.
Where does it hurt?
Here.
Do you have a fever?
No, I don’t think so.
Let me look at your throat. Open your mouth. Your throat’s red. Does it hurt?
Yes. It’s sore.
When did it start to feel this way?
Last week.
I think you have a virus. It might be the flu. I’m going to give you a prescription for some medicine.
Thank you.
Try to get some rest, and be sure to drink lots of water and orange juice.

Kevin, what would you like to do?
I don’t know. Maybe watch TV.
That’s a good idea. We’re going shopping later so I think you should rest for a while.
I don’t think I want to go anymore.
What do you mean? I thought you said we were going shopping.
I know, but I changed my mind. I’m too tired.
Well, I still have a lot of stuff to buy. When do you think we’ll go?
Maybe tonight.
OK, would you mind if I use your phone?
Sorry, I don’t have a signal.
Are you kidding? I usually have really good reception here.

What if I take it outside?
Yes, that’s fine. It works well outside.
###
Andrew, would you like to play a game?
OK, what kind of game?
Let’s play cards. Do you know how to play Blackjack?
Yes, that’s an easy game. I don’t want to play that right now.
OK, Do you remember how to play poker?
I think so, but you’re going to have to explain the rules to me again.
Look at this piece of paper. It has all the rules on it.
OK, yes. I remember now. I think the last time we played this game, you won and I lost.
Yes, that was fun.
OK, let’s play, but this time I don’t want to bet money.
OK, we won’t bet. We’ll just play for fun. 
###
Angela, come in.
Happy Birthday!
Thanks. I can’t believe you remembered that.
Well, I have a calendar on my computer. It helps me remember things like that. What are you up to?
I’m reading a book my cousin gave me for my birthday.
Let me see. Oh, I have this book at home. I want to give you a present too.
Wow, it’s a guitar. I already have one, but I like this one better. Thank you.
You’re welcome. Do you know how to play the guitar?
Yeah, I know how to play. My father taught me when I was young.
Will you play it now? I want to listen to some music.
Do you know this one?
Yeah, I’ve heard that one. I could sing that song when I was in middle school.
It’s an old one. It makes me feel old. When I was in college they use to play it on the radio all the time.
###

I’d also like to mail this letter.
Do you need to buy stamps?
Yes.
A book of stamps costs 3 dollars. So that’ll be 23 dollars for everything.
Oh, I forgot my wallet in the car. I’ll be right back. 
###
Patrick, why didn’t you call me last night? I was worried about you.
Sorry, I was sick. I went to bed early.
What’s wrong?
I had a cough and my eyes were really dry.
Are you better now?
Yes, I’m feeling a lot better. Much better than yesterday.
Do you have allergies?
Yes. The last time I went to the doctor, he did some tests and told me I have allergies. It gets worse in the spring.
What time did you wake up this morning?
Around 9:30 AM.
Are you going to work today?
No. I think I’ll just stay home and watch TV. I can work from home today.
Good. Get some rest and I’ll bring over some food later.
Thanks.
###
Hi Rachel!
Hi Josh! It’s been a long time. Where are you working now?
I work at a software company downtown. I’m an engineer.
That’s interesting. What kind of software do you write?
It’s a database for small businesses.
Does your company have a website?
Yes.
What’s the website address?
http://www.sun.com
How can I get the software?
You can download it from the website. It’s very popular and it’s free.
OK, I’ll do that. I have to go now. It was really nice seeing you again.
It was nice seeing you too. Email me next week and we’ll get together for coffee.
My computer is broken so I can’t send an email right now. Can I call you?
Sure, my number is 233-288-2328.
###
What are you listening to?
I’m listening to the radio.
I know that. Who are they playing?
Guess.
I think that’s the Beatles, right?
That’s right. How did you know that?
In my country, everyone knows who they are. They’re famous.
Really?
Of course. My parents saw them at a concert a long time ago.
Did you know that they’re from England?
Yes, of course.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
I listen to everything, but my favorite is Pop.
I see. Who’s your favorite singer?
Celine Dion.
I like her too. She’s got a great voice.
###
Hello Miss, do you need a taxi?
Yes.
Do you have any luggage?
Just these two suitcases.
OK, I’ll put them in the back for you. Where are you going?
The Comfort Inn.
I think there are two in Boston. Which one are you going to?
The one downtown.
Is this your first time in Boston?
No. I’ve been here many times. I come here for work all the time. Do you know how long it’ll take?
It shouldn’t take long. Probably about 15 minutes.
Wow, it looks like the traffic is really bad.
Yeah, there might be an accident up ahead.
OK, then stop at the next intersection. I’m gonna get out there and take the subway.
###
Are you hungry?
No, why?
We’ve been driving for a long time. I think we’d better find some place to eat soon.
No, I’m OK. We’re late so we’d better not stop.
We’ve passed that same store three times already. I think we’re lost. We should ask someone for directions.
We’re not lost.
I’ve never gone this way before. Do you know where you’re going?
Yes, this road goes through town. It’s faster than the highway.
Would you mind driving a little slower, please?
Sure, no problem.
Did you see that sign back there? I think this is a one-way street.
No, I didn’t see it. I’m going to have to turn around.
You can’t turn around here. I think you should let me drive.
I think you’re right. I’m getting tired. 
###
Adam, can you do me a favor?
Sure.
I can’t find my purse. Can you help me?
No problem, I’ll help you look for it.
Thanks.
What color is it?
It’s black.
Did you look in the kitchen?
Yes, I already looked there.
I’ll look in the living room.
Did you find it?
No. It’s not in there. When was the last time you saw it?
I had it when I went to the library this morning.
Do you think you might have left it there?
Maybe. I’ll call the library and ask them if anyone found it.
Wait! Is this it?
Yes, That’s it. That’s my purse. Thanks for helping me find it.
###
Excuse me, sir, will you take a picture of us?
Sure. This is a really nice camera.
Thanks, my parents gave it to me.
How do you use it?
You press this button here.
Come a little closer. Wait, that’s too close. Move a little to the left. Move back a little farther. OK, stay right there.
Do you mean here?
Yes, that’s good. Oh, I can’t get it to work.
You need to hold down the button for about 3 seconds.
OK, I got it, are you ready?
Yes.
Smile.
###
Hi Tracy. What’s going on?
Hi Thomas. I’m waiting in line to buy a DVD player.
The line is too long. Why don’t you come back tomorrow?
I think you’re right. They’re going to close soon.
Let’s go get some coffee.
Wait a minute, I have to get something out of my purse. Will you hold this for me?
Sure. Oops.
What happened?
I dropped your calculator. Is it broken?
I’m not sure. Let me have a look. No, I don’t think it’s broken. The button came off though. I can fix it.
Sorry about that.
Don’t worry about it. I do that all the time. If it is broken, I have another one in my car.
###
Hey, how did you get here?
I rode my bike.
Are you serious? Why did you do that? I could have picked you up.
That’s OK, I didn’t want to bother you. I know you don’t like to wake up early.
That’s so nice of you. Aren’t you cold?
No, not really. I wore a coat.
###
What’s in the bag?
It’s a special type of apple.
Oh. Can I try one? It’s very sweet.
I put sugar on it. These apples are really good. They were only 30 cents each.
Aren’t those more expensive than the ones at the supermarket?
Yeah, they’re more expensive, but they taste better.
Did you buy any other fruit?
Well, besides the apples, I bought oranges and bananas.
###
Hello?
Hi. Are you still up?
Yes.
You sound tired, is everything OK?
Yeah, everything’s fine. I’m just getting ready to go to bed. It’s been a really long day.
Do you have time to get some coffee with me later? I’ve something I want to talk to you about.
No, sorry. Not today. I have to get up early tomorrow.
Oh, What are you going to do tomorrow?
My mother-in-law is coming over so I have to get up early and clean the house.
I see.
Are you free tomorrow?
Yes, in the afternoon. I have to finish something I’m working on, but I’ll be free after 3:30.
Do you want to get together after you finish work?
Do you think you’ll have time?
Yeah, my mother-in-law will be leaving here around 2 PM.
###
Hey, I just talked to Jim.
What did he say?
He said he had to cancel the meeting this afternoon.
Oh, I see.
Is there a problem?
No, It’s not a big deal. He and I were supposed to talk to some new customers today.
Sorry to hear that.
It’s OK. This has been happening quite a bit recently.
That’s strange. I wonder why?
His wife has been sick, so sometimes he has to go home early to take care of her.
I see. How’s work been going?
Things are slow right now. Would you mind if I borrow your phone, mine’s out of batteries and I have to call my boss to tell him about this.
OK, let me go get it. It’s in the car.
###
Hello?
Hi John, sorry for calling so late, I hope I didn’t wake you up.
Actually, I was just finishing some work. I haven’t gone to bed yet.
Did you hear Bill got fired yesterday?
No. I didn’t hear that. Are you sure?
Yeah, Sarah told me this afternoon. She was pretty upset about it.
That’s too bad. Bill’s a nice guy.
Yeah, I know.
Why did they fire him?
She didn’t say.
I see. Well, if you talk to Sara again, tell her there’s a job opening at my company. Bill can have an interview this week if he wants.
Oh, thank you so much. I’ll call her and tell her.
###
Hi Jim.
You look upset, what’s wrong?
It’s nothing. I’m just a little nervous.
Is everything all right?
Well, I’m having surgery tomorrow on my finger.
What’s wrong with your finger?
I broke it the other day playing basketball.
Oh, that’s terrible.
Yeah, it’s been bothering me since that day.
Are you afraid of having surgery?
Yes. I’ve never had surgery before.
I wouldn’t worry. I had to have surgery on my leg last year. Everything went fine.
Were you nervous before the surgery?
A little. Who’s your doctor?
Dr. Allen.
Oh, I’ve heard he’s really good. I don’t think you have anything to worry about.
Good. That makes me feel much better.
###
Betty, are you and John still dating?
Yeah, things are going really good.
Where did you meet him?
I met him at the library a couple of weeks ago. We were sitting at the same table and he asked to borrow my pen.
Wow, that’s a nice story.
I was telling Jim about it the other day. He thought it was pretty romantic.
Do you two have plans for tonight?
Yes, I think we’re going to rent a movie. Have you seen anything good lately?
I saw Spider-Man the other day.
I’ve heard that’s a really funny movie.
Are you kidding? That movie’s not funny. It’s sad. I was crying at the end.
You’re really sensitive, aren’t you?
I guess so. Maybe that’s why I can’t find a girlfriend.
###
Hi Peter, can I talk to you for a moment? I just heard the cookie factory downtown is going out of business.
Where did you hear that?
Sara told me.
I’m not sure that’s true. I haven’t heard anything about it.
She said that they have already started to lay people off.
Doesn’t your father work there?
Yes, I’m really worried he might get laid off, he just started to work there about three months ago. What do you think I should do?
I’d talk to your father.
Yeah, but if there was something wrong I don’t think he’d tell me. He doesn’t like to upset me, but I really would like to know what’s going on.
So what are you gonna do?
Aren’t you good friends with the president of that company?
Yes, we use to work together at a different company about five years ago.
Maybe you could call him and see what’s going on.
Well, I don’t know. I guess I could. It’s pretty late now, but I’ll call him in the morning.
OK, thanks so much.
###
Wow, I’m really getting fat.
You don’t look fat.
Yes, but I am. I’ve gained 10 pounds in the last two months. Look at my stomach.
How much do you weigh?
I think about 170 pounds.
What kind of foods do you eat?
I usually have pasta for dinner. Sometimes I get take-out or fast food if I don’t have enough time to cook.
I was reading a diet book the other day. It said that if you eat meat and nothing else, you’ll lose weight quickly.
Wow, does that work?
I don’t know, but someone told me they tried it and lost 20 pounds.
That sounds good, but I’m not sure how long I could do that.
I know, once you start eating vegetables and bread again you’ll probably start gaining weight.
Well, I think I’m going to try it anyway. Who’s the author?
I can’t remember. It’s not that popular anymore. When I get home I’ll check and give you a call.
###
Hello?
Hi Sarah, it’s James.
Hey James, I can’t talk now. Can I call you back later?
Sure. Is there a problem?
I’m late for work and my car isn’t working, so I need to find someone to take me to work.
I can take you.
Oh, really? Thank you. That would help a lot.
Do you need me to pick you up after work also?
Yes, if it’s not too much trouble.
It’s no problem. I’m leaving my house now. I’ll be right there.
OK. I’ll wait for you in front of my apartment building.
Do you know what’s wrong with your car?
I’m not exactly sure. I think there’s a problem with the engine.
OK, I’ll have a look when I get there. I know a lot about cars. When I was younger my father and I use to fix old cars. 
###
Hey, what have you been doing today?
Nothing, just watching TV. I’m really bored. I don’t have anything to do.
I don’t have anything to do either. I didn’t do anything today except clean my house.
I know. I was planning to go to the mall today with one of my friends, but it snowed so much we couldn’t go anywhere.
I hope it snows all night because I don’t want to go to school tomorrow.
Do you know anyone who has a camera? I want to take a picture of all this snow.
No, I don’t know anyone who has a camera.
Have you seen Sara today? I think she might have one.
No, she hasn’t been around all day. She said she had something important to do today?
Oh, where did she go?
Nobody knows. I called her roommate and she doesn’t know either.
###
Mandy, did you know Heather called you?
No. When did she call?
Two hours ago, I think.
Two hours ago? Why didn’t you tell me earlier?
Sorry, I forgot.
What did she say?
She said she was waiting for you at her sister’s place.
OK, I was going to cook dinner first, but I don’t think I have enough time now. I’ll just warm up some leftovers in the microwave.
OK.
If she calls again, tell her I’m gonna be late.
OK, no problem.
This is very important. Don’t forget.
Don’t worry. I won’t forget.
Actually, would you please hand me my phone? I think I should give her a call now. She’s probably wondering where I am.
Sure, I’ll get it for you.
###
I’m going shopping. Do you want to come?
I thought you went shopping yesterday.
I did, but an old friend called me last night and invited me to his birthday party. I need to buy a gift for him.
I see. What are you going to get him?
I really have no idea what he likes. I haven’t seen him in a long time. What do you think?
Maybe a cake?
Well, that’s a good idea, but I think I should probably get him something else, like something he can wear.
How about a sweater? I saw a really nice one in the mall the other day. Maybe we can go there and take a look.
OK, what store was it in?
It was at Macy’s. I think they’re having a sale this weekend.
Oh, that’s a really nice store. I like the clothes there.
###
Hey Diane, what are you doing here?
Hi, Tim, how are you? I’m waiting for a friend.
I heard you’re going to graduate this summer. Is that true?
Yes. If everything goes alright, I’ll be getting my bachelor’s degree in August. Then I need to start looking for a job.
I had to do that last year. It wasn’t easy. Do you have any job offers?
No, not yet. I sent out a lot of resumes, but I didn’t receive many responses. It’s pretty hard to find a job right now.
What’s your major?
Psychology.
That was my major when I started college, but I switched to engineering after the first year.
I think it’s easier for engineers to find a job.
I’m not sure about that. It took me about 3 months to find a job. I finally was able to get a job after I put my resume on one of those job websites.
Anyway, it really doesn’t matter. If I can’t find a job I’ll probably go back to school to get my Masters degree.
###
Hello?
Hey Gary. What’s up?
I haven’t talked to you in a long time, what’s been happening?
Well, I don’t know if you heard, but I just moved into a new apartment in LA.
No, I heard you were thinking about moving but I didn’t know you’d already found a place. That’s cool.
Yeah, I’m really happy about it.
Do you have any roommates?
No, not this time. It’s a big change for me ’cause I’ve never lived alone.
Don’t you think you’ll be lonely?
Not really, I have two friends who live in the same building. We all had dinner together last night.
Are they students also?
No, they’re not students, but there are a lot of students living in the building.
Sounds like a nice place.
Yeah, I think it’s a good environment for learning English.
Well, I’m glad to hear everything worked out.
You should come out here and visit me sometime. There’s even a pool.
That would be nice. I’ll think about it.
###
Justin, have you found a girlfriend yet?
No, not yet.
What about Jenny?
She has a boyfriend.
Oh, I thought they broke up.
No, they’re still together.
How about that girl from work you were telling me about last year?
Who, Emily? She’s married now. She got married last month.
I see. It seems like everyone our age is married.
Yeah, it’s not easy.
Is there anyone you’re interested in?
There is one girl I like who lives in my building. I talk to her a lot because she’s also studying English.
What’s she like?
She’s really nice. She moved here from Texas about 3 months ago.
What does she do?
She’s an accountant.
That’s a good job. She must be really smart. Have you asked her out yet?
Actually we’re going to dinner on Friday.
Good luck.
###
Hi Jason, Sorry to bother you. I have a question for you.
OK, what’s up?
I’ve been having a problem with my computer. I know you’re an engineer so I thought you might be able to help me.
I see. What’s the problem?
I have a file that I can’t open for some reason.
What type of file is it?
It’s a Word document I’ve been working on. I need to finish it by tomorrow.
Were you able to open it before, on the computer you’re using now?
Yes, I was working on it last night and everything was fine, but this morning I couldn’t open the file.
Do you think your computer might have a virus?
No, I checked and there weren’t any.
I’m not sure what’s wrong. If it’s possible, email the file to me and I’ll see if I can get it to open.
OK, I’ll do that when I get home. Are you going to be around tonight?
Yeah, I’ll be home after 8 PM. Send it to me when you get a chance and I’ll call you later.
###
Hi George, do you know how to get downtown?
Sure. Why are you going there?
I want to buy a new computer.
OK, are you driving?
Yes.
Go straight down this road. When you get to the second light, take a left. Then get on the highway and take exit 52.
That sounds really complicated. Can you tell me again? Which road do I take first?
You go down this road, then at the second light, turn left. That road is Main street.
OK, I think I’ve got it now.
Why are you buying a new computer anyway? Didn’t you just get one a few months ago?
Yes, but it doesn’t work anymore.
Where did you buy it?
At Wal-Mart.
I think your computer should still be under warranty. You can bring it back to them and they’ll fix it for free.
I think you’re right. I didn’t think about that. I should go talk to them about it. Where is the closest Wal-Mart?
It’s about 2 blocks from here. I have to go there to get some stuff now anyway. Do you want to follow me?
Sure.
###
John, did you see the news today?
No, what happened?
There was a big earthquake in San Diego.
Oh my goodness.
The president was on the news talking about it earlier.
Was anyone hurt?
I think they said two people were killed.
Oh, that’s terrible.
Yeah, I can’t believe you hadn’t heard about it. They were talking about it on CNN all day.
Oh, I don’t watch TV that often.
Don’t you watch the news?
No, I usually read the news online, but I haven’t had time to turn on my computer today.
###
What’s your favorite sport?
I like basketball. I watch the games on TV all the time.
Who’s your favorite team?
The Boston Celtics.
They’re really good this year, aren’t they?
Yes. Do you like them?
Yes. Everyone around here does.
Do you think they’ll win the championship this year?
It’s possible. They have some really good players.
Did you watch the game last night?
A little, not the whole thing. I watched the second half though and I saw some of the highlights online.
It was a great game, wasn’t it?
Yeah. Do you know who they’re playing tomorrow night?
I think they’re playing LA.
That’s going to be a tough game. LA has a good team. 
###
Hi Liz. Are you working on your webpage now?
No, I’m still waiting for you to send me that image file for the homepage.
Do you mean you didn’t get it? I sent it to you over an hour ago.
Let me check. It’s going to take a second ’cause I have to start up my computer.
Did you get it?
One second. I just have to open my web browser and check my Hotmail account.
OK.
OK, here it is. I got it.
How do I find the webpage? I tried to search for it on Yahoo but I couldn’t find it.
Don’t use Yahoo, use Google.
I tried that also and it didn’t work.
If you go to Google and search for my name, you should be able to find it.
Let me try that. I see it now.
###
Hey Michael, I’m tired. Would you mind driving for a while?
Sorry. I would like to, but I don’t know how to drive.
Really? Don’t you have a license? I thought everyone had a license.
No, I’ve lived in cities all my life and when I’m at home I usually take the subway or bus.
I see. Do you think you’ll learn to drive in the future?
Yes. I plan to buy a car next year. I think you need one in the US.
Actually, now that I think about it, a lot of people in cities here take the bus also.
Well, I’d like to travel more. I’ve been here for a few months already and I feel like I haven’t seen anything yet.
How are you going to learn to drive? Do you want me to teach you?
No, I wouldn’t want to trouble you. I’ve already signed up for a class near my house. It starts next month.
###
Thomas, your English is so good. How did you learn it?
Well, in my country everyone has to take English starting in the first grade. I’ve been taking English courses for 12 years now.
Wow, that’s interesting. I remember when we took that trip last year and visited your family. It seemed like there weren’t many people that could speak with me in English.
Oh, that’s because they don’t speak English that much.
But they speak it in school, right? Maybe they just didn’t like me so they didn’t want to talk to me.
No, actually they liked you a lot. They told me they thought you were very nice. They are just shy. They’re not used to talking with foreigners. I remember when I first came to the US. I was really nervous about speaking with people.
I see. I thought there were lots of Americans teaching English in your country.
Yes, that’s true. There are probably twice as many now as there were five years ago, but they are mostly in the cities. My family lives in the country.
I wonder why. Personally, I prefer the country to the city. It’s so quiet and peaceful. If I were to teach, I would want to teach in the country.
Do you think you would want to teach someday? I know the schools around my town are looking for teachers, so if you want, I can call them and get more information.
No, I don’t think so. I would need to stay there for a year, and I don’t think I can take that much time off work.
Well, if you change your mind, let me know. I think you would be a really great teacher. 
###
Dorothy, what are your plans for Christmas?
Oh yes, it’s almost Christmas, isn’t it? I’m not sure what I’ll be doing then.
Well, if you don’t have any plans, your family could have dinner at my house.
That’s very nice of you, thanks. Have you finished your shopping yet?
No, I still have to do that. I think I’ll go to the mall this weekend.
It’s going to be really crowded at the mall. You should shop online.
You’re right. My family loves to read, so I can probably get them all presents from Amazon.com.
What do you think you’ll get for your wife?
Probably a romance novel. It seems like she’s always reading one of those.
Don’t you think you should get her something a little more expensive, like jewelry or maybe a new computer?
Maybe you’re right. It’s hard buying gifts. I think my wife has everything she wants. Maybe I should just ask her.
###
Martin, who are you going to vote for?
Do you mean for the president?
Yes.
I’m not sure yet.
You should make up your mind soon. The election is next month.
Yes, I know. I hear about it every day on the news.
I’m going to vote for Obama.
I think he is a good choice, but I think McCain would make a good president also.
I know. They’re both good. It’s hard to decide. McCain is older but he has more experience. Obama seems to have a lot of good ideas, but some people say he wants to raise taxes.
I heard he wants to lower taxes. It’s hard to know what the truth is. That’s the reason I really don’t pay attention to politics.
Yes, it can be frustrating, but it’s important and it’s interesting to watch.
###
Hey John, can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure, what’s up?

Oh, that sounds like fun. When does the group meet?
Usually the last Saturday of the month at 9:30 in the evening. Is that too late for you?
No, I think that’s ok. What do you talk about in the group?
Well, every month we choose a new book and then during the next meeting we discuss it.
What book are you reading now?
The Kite Runner.
I’ve heard that’s a good book. What’s it about?
It is a good book. I’m almost finished. The book is about a boy who grows up in Afghanistan during the 1980s. It’s called the Kite Runner because the main character takes part in a kite flying competition.
That sounds really interesting. I’d love to come.
Ok, great. The next meeting isn’t for another two weeks, so you still have time to read the book.

Being made of traditional material, it looks trendy, though. My handcraft bag has A4 paper size, which is large enough to carry a bunch of stuff: makeup things, a wallet, and tissues.
How is it made?
Luckily, I had a chance to see how it is made. People spent the whole day knitting hundreds of small bamboo fibers together to make one bag.
Is it easy to make?
Nope. I’m not really skillful and patient, so handcrafts seem super hard for me.
What is special about it?
The material itself is what makes it special. It’s eco-friendly as well.
Does it remind you of something?
Yup. It reminds me of the peaceful and quiet atmosphere of the countryside where I visited.
